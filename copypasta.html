It's been fun, I hope someone organizes meet ups for the cohort in the future. I didn't get to say bye to ppl because of coronavirus. Also, I hope the events don't have alcohol and stuff (one of the main reasons I didn't go to many events in school :/)
First couple of years, mental health seemed to be a very u underestimated or undertalked struggle. The last couple of years (basically since 3rd year) the university has been a bit better providing resources and recognizing it as an important subject. However, I still think more needs to be done on a cohort/department basis. That being said, all the program directors and supervisors I have had the pleasure to go through SE with have been super helpful and amazing!

I feel like most people are different than they were in a good way compared to first year. It was cool seeing people change and grow :)

Also:

We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling

Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
Inside we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it
And if you ask me how I'm feeling

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little script kiddie? I'll have you know I applied to Geomatics and got deferred to Software Engineering, and I have over 300 confirmed side projects. I am trained in Cracking the Coding Interview and have been involved in numerous Cali co-ops. You are nothing to me but a filthy highschool applicant. I will out-meme you with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this campus, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. as we speak I am contacting my past employers at the Big 4 and your applications are being traced right now so you better prepare for continuous, maggot. The round that wipes out your pathetic chances of getting employed. You're fucking jobless, kid. I can code in any language, on any OS, and I can hack you in over 9000 ways, and that's just using SQL injections. Not only am I extensively trained in Assembly, but I have access to the entire database of WaterlooWorks and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable résumé off the face of the campus, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your shitty "planning for cali" post was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have gone to UofT instead. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will code brainfuck all over you and you will drown in all the things #FEDSdoes. You're fucking screened but not selected, kiddo.

I've never been much of a mobile gamer, but, forget everything you think you know about mobile games because Raid Shadow Legends is one of the most ambitious RPG projects of 2019 has just been released and will change everything. Just look at the level of detail of these characters! If you use the code in the description you can start with 50,000 silver and join the Special Launch Tournament, and you better hurry because it's getting big fast! You can play for totally free with the link below on your smartphone.

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in Software Engineering, and I've been involved in numerous Cali co-op terms, and I have over 300k confirmed losses on Robinhood. I am trained in gorilla programming and I'm the top full stack engineer in the entire silicon valley. You are nothing to me but just another first year. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on Leetcode, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of hackers across Cali and your IP is being tracerouted right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your co-op. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can find the shortest path in a graph in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my non-mechanical keyboard. Not only am I extensively trained in algorithms, but I have access to the entire arsenal of Cali co-op students and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable startup off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" startup idea was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will code fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking negative cycle eliminated, kiddo.

I don't think SE is what many people (especially asian parents) believe it to be. While parts of it are nice, I think most people are better suited in a different program. I think a good strategy is to stay in the program for 1-2 years to get to know people, then transfer to CS.

Look buddy, I'm an engineer. That means I solve problems, not problems like "is Linux better than MacOS?" because that would fall within the purviews of solved conundrums where the answer is yes. I solve practical problems. For example, how am I going to stop some mean Mac fanboy from ruining my code? The answer is C++. And if that don't work? Use more C++. Like this here little old hello world C++ program written by me, only understood by me, and you best hope, not needing maintenance by you.
